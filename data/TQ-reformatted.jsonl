The theorem states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, if one side is 9 inches and the other is 12 inches, then the length of the hypotenuse is $$\\sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = \\sqrt{81 + 144} = \\sqrt{225} = 15$$ inches long.

In vitro is Latin for \u201cin glass\u201d and describes medical procedures, tests, and experiments that researchers perform outside of a living organism. An in vitro study occurs in a controlled environment, such as a test tube or petri dish. This methodology allows scientists to evaluate various biological phenomena in specific cells without the distractions and potential confounding variables present in whole organisms. However, although petri dishes and test tubes provide controlled environments for in vitro testing, they cannot replicate the conditions that occur inside a living organism. As a result, it is necessary to interpret in vitro data with caution, as these results do not necessarily predict the reaction of an entire living being. Some examples of in vitro testing include pharmaceutical testing and fertility treatments.","golden_judge":1}

The Penrose Stairs, also known as the Penrose Steps or the Impossible Staircase, is an impossible object created by Oscar Reutersv\u00e4rd in 1937 and later independently discovered and made popular by Lionel Penrose and his son Roger Penrose. It is a two-dimensional depiction of a staircase in which the stairs make four 90-degree turns as they ascend or descend yet form a continuous loop, so that a person could climb them forever and never get any higher.\n\nThe Devil's Pitchfork, also known as the Blivet or the Devil's Tuning Fork, is another impossible object and optical illusion. It is a two-pronged trident that appears to have three cylindrical prongs at one end. The prongs appear normal when viewed individually, but when viewed together, it becomes clear that something is not quite right with their attachment.\n\nBoth of these objects have been popularized in art and culture and continue to fascinate people with their intriguing impossibility.","golden_judge":1}

Vesuvius, where they were joined by other escaped slaves. The rebellion grew in size and strength, and Spartacus\u2019s forces were able to defeat several Roman armies before finally being defeated by Marcus Licinius Crassus in 71 BCE.

Approximately 90% of the energy used by an incandescent bulb is lost as heat, while only 10% is converted to light. This is why incandescent bulbs become hot to the touch when they are in use. There are more efficient alternatives available, such as compact fluorescent bulbs (CFLs) and light emitting diodes (LEDs), which waste much less energy as heat and can help conserve electricity.","golden_judge":1}

Charles ascended to the English throne in 1625 following the death of his father, King James I. During Charles\u2019 reign, his actions frustrated his Parliament and resulted in the wars of the English Civil War, eventually leading to his execution in 1649. After his defeat by Parliament in the Civil Wars, Charles I was imprisoned. On 20 January 1649, the High Court of Justice at Westminster Hall put him on trial for treason. Putting a king on trial was a contentious issue. When it came to the trial, those who were against it were turned away or arrested. The remaining parliament was known as the \u2018rump\u2019 parliament. The King refused to cooperate. He did not enter a plea or recognize the legitimacy of the court. Yet just seven days later, the judges returned a guilty verdict and passed the sentence of execution: \u2018This Court doth adjudge that he the said Charles Stuart, as a Tyrant, Traitor, Murderer and Public Enemy to the good people of this Nation, [and] shall be put to death, by the severing of his head from his body\u2019.","golden_judge":1}

{"qid":1282,"system":"newbing","question":"\"In Victorian England, what was a \"\"reticule\"\"?\"","golden_answer":"Sacking and Sack Manufacture||Bag||BAG","system_answer":"A reticule, also known as a ridicule or indispensable, was a type of small handbag or purse, similar to a modern evening bag, used mainly from 1795 to 1820. The name \"reticule\" came from the French r\u00e9ticule, which in turn came from the Latin reticulum, a diminutive of rete, or \"net\". Reticules were made in a variety of styles and shapes and sometimes trimmed with embroidery or beading. Women often made their own reticules.\n\nIn Victorian England, the reticule was becoming more commonplace among women who were no longer confined to the home. Up to this point, most women\u2019s fashions were void of any pockets in which to carry small belongings. The hanging pocket or reticule bag had been the one purse style that allowed middle and upper-class women to go shopping, traveling, visiting friends, and leaving calling cards with ease. It was carried in hand, shaped like the inside of a pocket. It held only a few critical items such as a handkerchief, fan, pencil, and cards. Victorian reticule bags (jokingly called indispensables in Britain) were decorated in patterns of roses, birds, buttercups, and daisies made of small beads or embroidered wool. Fancy ones were trimmed in ribbon, braiding, tassels, and fringe.","golden_judge":1}

{"qid":1441,"system":"newbing","question":"Anemia can be caused by a deficiency of what dietary mineral?","golden_answer":"Iron Essay||Siderol||Extraction of iron||Nephro-Fer||Ferrousal","system_answer":"Anemia can be caused by a deficiency of several dietary minerals. The most common type of anemia is iron-deficiency anemia, which is caused by a lack of iron in the body. Iron is an essential mineral that helps red blood cells carry oxygen to the body's tissues. When there is not enough iron, the body cannot produce enough hemoglobin, which is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. This can lead to anemia and its associated symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\n\nIn addition to iron, other dietary minerals that can cause anemia if deficient include vitamin B-12 and folate (vitamin B-9). Vitamin B-12 is mainly found in animal products such as meat, eggs, and dairy, while folate is found in foods such as leafy green vegetables, fruits, and legumes. A deficiency in either of these vitamins can lead to a type of anemia called vitamin-deficiency anemia.\n\nIt's important to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods rich in these essential nutrients to help prevent anemia. If you are concerned about your nutrient intake or have been diagnosed with anemia, it's a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider for advice on how to manage the condition. They may recommend dietary changes or supplements to help improve your nutrient levels.","golden_judge":1}

The center ring, often called the \u201cbull\u2019s eye,\u201d is usually gold and worth 10 points. The rings surrounding the center have decreasing point values.

The trial\u2019s proceedings helped to bring the scientific evidence for evolution into the public sphere while also stoking a national debate over the veracity of evolution that continues to the present day.\n\nIn March 1925, the Tennessee legislature had passed the Butler Act, which declared unlawful the teaching of any doctrine denying the divine creation of man as taught by the Bible1. World attention focused on the trial proceedings, which promised and delivered confrontation between fundamentalist literal belief and liberal interpretation of the Scriptures1. William Jennings Bryan led for the prosecution and Clarence Darrow for the defense1.\n\nWith Raulston limiting the trial to the single question of whether Scopes had taught evolution, which he admittedly had, Scopes was convicted and fined $100 on July 211. On appeal, the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1925 law but acquitted Scopes on the technicality that he had been fined excessively1. ","golden_judge":1}

The names of these two dishes are a bit of a culinary mystery, but we can see the obvious ways in which they differ.\n\n\u201cAngels on Horseback\u201d are older than its counterpart, originating in the 19th century, and are made by wrapping oysters in bacon, baking or frying them, and serving them on bread1. The name may stem from the fact that the curled edges of the pinned bacon resemble angel wings, and they\u2019re often served with lemon or lime juice1.\n\nLater in the culinary timeline, \u201cDevils on Horseback\u201d entered the scene, with a name perhaps inspired by the dish\u2019s red and black coloring1. This dish is made by taking pitted, large prunes (or sometimes dates) and wrapping them in bacon, much like the oysters in the \u201cangel\u201d recipe, and the prunes can even be stuffed with cheese or chutney1.\n\n","golden_judge":1}
